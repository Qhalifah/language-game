This is the Dina'ki Adventures Language Game Editor. This is a shared creation of Shaun Bond, Jeffery Waldon, Charlie Carlson, Simon Smith, Joseph DeWilde, and Aaron Andrews. This program was created for the Alaskan Native Language Archive as a way to preserve the Dina'ki language. This game editor is meant to create the levels of the Dina'ki Adventures language game as a way to pass down knowledge of the Dina'ki language to the next generation, as this language has few speakers left, and is in danger of dying out.

This project can be found on Github at https://github.com/spbond/language-game

Please report any problems found with this program or the Dinaki Adventures game player to the Issues there.
